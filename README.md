# AI-Powered Medical Imaging Diagnosis Platform (AWS + Terraform)

A cloud-native solution for automating medical imaging diagnosis using AI/ML models. Built on AWS with Terraform for infrastructure-as-code (IaC), this project enables secure, HIPAA-compliant uploads of medical images (MRI, CT scans, X-rays) and provides AI-generated diagnostic reports with real-time notifications.

## Features
- **Secure Uploads**: Presigned S3 URLs + AWS KMS encryption for medical imaging files.
- **AI/ML Processing**: Auto-scaling EC2 Spot Instances for cost-efficient model inference.
- **Serverless APIs**: Lambda + API Gateway for patient/doctor interactions.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: SNS notifications for report completion.
- **Compliance**: HIPAA/GDPR-ready (encryption, WAF, IAM least privilege).
